'''
This function takes training data as a parameter and the rules csv file as the second parameter that was
outputed from the sequential covering algorithm script. It then outputs a csv file containing all the documents
that were classified as granted or denied. The outputed csv file is called Foil_classifier_.csv or Simple_classifier_.csv depending on the 3rd parameter of the function.
It has 5 colunns: index of the rule, the rule, the Foil Information Gain function statistic for that rule, document id, and
motion result code as binary.

Command to run the script: python3 name_of_this_file.py your_testing_data your_rules type
type is simple or foil

    Reads in the tab delimited testing data and one hot encodes motion result code. GR (granted) is 1
